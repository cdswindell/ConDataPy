# ConDataPy
Python version of Java TMS (Consumable Data)

===

Consumable Data (formerly TMS)

Consumable Data Software (CDS) is a framework for ad-hoc analysis of complex data. Developed in 100% pure Python, its special ability is that it allows users to defined derived columns,
derived rows, and derived cells, to perform ad-hoc data analyses. Consumable Data provides a rich language of over 250 functions (see below), as well as allows developers to
code their own functions to operate on standard or custom datatypes from within the framework. TMS allows Java developers to easily incorporate spreadsheet-like analytics
capability into web and applet applications.

CDS data structures are performant, and the project uses test-driven development to provide quality and code coverage.
A rich API is provided that allows developers to easily and quickly integrate CDS into their applications. Full documentation and source are provided.

See the TMS Wiki at https://github.com/cdswindell/tms/wiki for complete details and to learn how to become involved.

See the TMS API Javadoc at http://cdswindell.github.io/tms/doc for details on using the TMS API.
